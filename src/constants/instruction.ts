  'Harmony only assesses your facial proportions, angles, and the relative positioning of features. It does not factor in features like hair color, skin color, eye color, skin health, and eye contrast, which can all play a role in facial attractiveness.',
  'You can adjust your score accordingly based on those other factors. For example, if you have severe acne, your overall beauty score may be lower than your harmony score. Though, for the most part your harmony score should represent the majority of criteria that factor into beauty. Think of facial harmony as the foundation of beauty and the rest of your features sit on that foundation.',
  'Premium users are only allowed five saved report profiles at once. You can download your report from "Saved Profiles".',
  "Your front score is not entirely separable from your side score; both interact with one another and affect each profile's appearance. For example, facial thirds affect how your side profile looks. Your jawâ€™s projection and related assessments also affect how your jawline appears in the front profile. Therefore, your front harmony score alone is not wholly representative of how harmonious your front profile is.",
